1. REAL WORLD SPAs (SINGLE PAGE APPLICATIONS) AND REACT WEB APPS

    • Youtube
    • Facebook
    • Instagram
    • Slack
    • Netflix
    • Twitter
    • Gmail

2. UNDERSTANDING SINGLE PAGE APPLICATION AND MULTIPAGE APPLICATION

    • SPAs are web applications that load a single HTML page and dynamically update its content without having to refresh the page. 

    • MPAs, on the other hand, are traditional web applications that reload the entire page every time a user interacts with the application. MPAs are typically easier to develop, as they don’t require as much client-side logic, and they can be more straightforward to maintain.
